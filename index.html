  <h2>🌍 Environmental Pollution</h2>
  <p>
    Environmental pollution is one of the most serious challenges facing the world today. It occurs when harmful substances are released into the air, water, or soil, causing damage to the ecosystem and human health. Industrial waste, vehicle emissions, plastic pollution, and deforestation are major contributors. Pollution not only harms wildlife and natural habitats but also leads to problems like climate change, global warming, and respiratory diseases in humans. Reducing pollution requires collective efforts such as using renewable energy, recycling, planting trees, and minimizing waste to protect our planet for future generations.
  </p>

  <h2>🌫️ Types of Environmental Pollution</h2>
  <p>
    Environmental pollution can be broadly classified into several types — <strong>air, water, soil, and noise pollution</strong>. Air pollution is caused by emissions from factories, vehicles, and burning fossil fuels, leading to smog and respiratory problems. Water pollution occurs when chemicals, plastics, and waste enter rivers, lakes, and oceans, making them unsafe for aquatic life and humans. Soil pollution results from pesticides, industrial waste, and deforestation, reducing soil fertility. Noise pollution, often overlooked, affects both physical and mental health due to constant loud sounds from urban areas.
  </p>

  <h2>🌱 Effects on Living Beings</h2>
  <p>
    Pollution has devastating effects on all living organisms. Contaminated air can lead to asthma, lung cancer, and heart diseases in humans. Polluted water causes severe health issues like cholera and diarrhea and kills marine life. Soil degradation affects food quality and crop yield, leading to hunger and malnutrition. Wildlife suffers habitat loss and poisoning due to toxins in the environment, disrupting entire ecosystems. Over time, this imbalance also contributes to <em>global warming and climate change</em>, endangering life on Earth.
  </p>

  <h2>🌎 Steps to Control Pollution</h2>
  <p>
    Reducing pollution requires a combination of government policies, technology, and individual actions. Governments can enforce strict emission laws and promote clean energy sources such as solar and wind power. Industries should treat waste before disposal and switch to eco-friendly production methods. Citizens can contribute by using public transport, reducing plastic use, recycling, and planting trees. Awareness and collective responsibility are key to restoring environmental balance and ensuring a cleaner, healthier planet for future generations.
