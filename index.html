  <h2>💻 Cybersecurity Awareness</h2>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity awareness is crucial in today’s digital world where most of our data, communication, and financial transactions happen online. It involves understanding the potential threats to digital systems and learning how to prevent unauthorized access or attacks. Cyber threats such as phishing, malware, ransomware, and identity theft can cause severe damage to individuals and organizations. Staying alert, using strong passwords, and keeping software updated are essential first steps to maintaining a secure online presence.
  </p>

  <h2>🔒 Common Cybersecurity Threats</h2>
  <p>
    Some of the most common cybersecurity threats include <strong>phishing attacks, data breaches, viruses, and social engineering</strong>. Phishing involves tricking users into revealing personal details through fake emails or websites. Malware and ransomware infect devices to steal or lock data until a ransom is paid. Social engineering manipulates human behavior to gain access to confidential systems. Regular awareness training and monitoring suspicious activity can significantly reduce these risks in both personal and professional environments.

  <h2>🧠 Impact on Individuals and Businesses</h2>
  <p>
    Cyberattacks have far-reaching impacts. For individuals, they can lead to financial loss, data exposure, or identity theft. For businesses, the consequences include loss of customer trust, legal issues, and operational downtime. A single data breach can cost millions and damage a company’s reputation permanently. With increasing digital transformation, maintaining strong cybersecurity measures has become a necessity rather than a choice. Organizations must invest in encryption, secure networks, and continuous employee training to ensure protection.

  <h2>🛡️ Best Practices for Cyber Safety</h2>
  <p>
    Building a culture of cybersecurity starts with small but consistent actions. Always use multi-factor authentication, avoid clicking on unknown links, and back up important data regularly. Use updated antivirus software and firewalls to protect against malicious attacks. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails or activity immediately. Governments and companies should also collaborate to establish stronger regulations and frameworks for data protection, ensuring a safer digital ecosystem for everyone.
